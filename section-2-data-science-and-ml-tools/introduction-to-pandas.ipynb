    "# A Quick Introduction to Data Analysis and Manipulation with Python and pandas\n",

    "\n",
    "## What is pandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're getting into machine learning and data science and you're using Python, you're going to use pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is an open source library which helps you analyse and manipulate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/pandas-6-step-ml-framework-tools-highlight.png\" alt=\"a 6 step machine learning framework along will tools you can use for each step\" width=\"700\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why pandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas provides a simple to use but very capable set of functions you can use to on your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's integrated with many other data science and machine learning tools which use Python so having an understanding of it will be helpful throughout your journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main use cases you'll come across is using pandas to transform your data in a way which makes it usable with machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What does this notebook cover?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the pandas library is vast, there's often many ways to do the same thing. This notebook covers some of the most fundamental functions of the library, which are more than enough to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where can I get help?\n",
    "If you get stuck or think of something you'd like to do which this notebook doesn't cover, don't fear!\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended steps you take are:\n",
    "1. **Try it** - Since pandas is very friendly, your first step should be to use what you know and try figure out the answer to your own question (getting it wrong is part of the process). If in doubt, run your code.\n",
    "2. **Search for it** - If trying it on your own doesn't work, since someone else has probably tried to do something similar, try searching for your problem. You'll likely end up in 1 of 2 places:\n",
    "    * [pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.25/) - the best place for learning pandas, this resource covers all of the pandas functionality.\n",
    "    * [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - this is the developers Q&A hub, it's full of questions and answers of different problems across a wide range of software development topics and chances are, there's one related to your problem.\n",
    "    \n",
    "An example of searching for a pandas function might be:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"how to fill all the missing values of two columns using pandas\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Searching this on Google leads to this post on Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36556256/how-do-i-fill-na-values-in-multiple-columns-in-pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "The next steps here are to read through the post and see if it relates to your problem. If it does, great, take the code/information you need and **rewrite it** to suit your own problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ask for help** - If you've been through the above 2 steps and you're still stuck, you might want to ask your question on Stack Overflow. Remember to be specific as possible and provide details on what you've tried.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, you don't have to learn all of these functions off by heart to begin with. \n",
    "\n",
    "What's most important is remembering to continually ask yourself, \"what am I trying to do with the data?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by answering that question and then practicing finding the code which does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started."

    "### Main topics we covered\n",
    "* [Series](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.html) - a single column (can be multiple rows) of values.\n",
    "* [DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/frame.html) - multiple columns/rows of values (a DataFrame is comprised of multiple Series).\n",
    "* [Importing data](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/io.html) - we used [`pd.read_csv()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html#pandas.read_csv) to read in a CSV (comma-separated values) file but there are multiple options for reading data.\n",
    "* [Exporting data](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/io.html) - we exported our data using `to_csv()`, however there are multiple methods of exporting data.\n",
    "* [Describing data](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/basics.html#attributes-and-underlying-data)\n",
    "    * `df.dtypes` - find the datatypes present in a dataframe.\n",
    "    * `df.describe()` - find various numerical features of a dataframe.\n",
    "    * `df.info()` - find the number of rows and whether or not any of them are empty.\n",
    "* [Viewing and selecting data](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/10min.html#viewing-data)\n",
    "    * `df.head()` - view the first 5 rows of `df`.\n",
    "    * `df.loc` & `df.iloc` - select specific parts of a dataframe.\n",
    "    * `df['A']` - select column `A` of `df`.\n",
    "    * `df[df['A'] > 1000]` - selection column `A` rows with values over 1000 of `df`.\n",
    "    * `df['A']` - plot values from column `A` using matplotlib (defaults to line graph).\n",
    "* [Manipulating data and performing operations](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/10min.html#operations) - pandas has many built-in functions you can use to manipulate data, also many of the Python operators (e.g. `+`, `-`, `>`, `==`) work with pandas.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Further reading\n",
    "Since pandas is such a large library, it would be impossible to cover it all in one go. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following are some resources you might want to look into for more.\n",
    "* [Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney](https://www.amazon.com.au/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython-ebook/dp/B075X4LT6K) - possibly the most complete text of the pandas library (apart from the documentation itself) written by the creator of pandas.\n",
    "* [Data Manipulation with Pandas (section of Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas)](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.00-introduction-to-pandas.html) - a very hands-on approach to many of the main functions in the pandas library.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercises\n",
    "After completing this notebook, you next thing should be to try out some more pandas code of your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd suggest at least going through number 1 (write out all the code yourself), a couple from number 2 (again, write out the code yourself) and spend an hour reading number 3 (this is vast but keep it in mind).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [10-minute introduction to pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/10min.html) - go through all the functions here and be sure to write out the code yourself.\n",
    "2. [Pandas getting started tutorial](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/intro_tutorials/index.html) - pick a couple from here which spark your interest and go through them both writing out the code for your self.\n",
