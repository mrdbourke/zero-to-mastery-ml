    "* **Inputs:** Bulldozer characteristics such as make year, base model, model series, state of sale (e.g. which US state was it sold in), drive system and more.\n",
    "* **Outputs:** Bulldozer sale price (in USD).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're trying to predict a number, this kind of problem is known as a **regression problem**.\n",

These filetypes have several advantages over CSV in terms of processing speeds and storage size. However, data stored in these formats is not human-readable so you won't be able to open the files and inspect them without specific tools.

    "| **Method** | **Pros**  | **Cons** |\n",
    "|-----|-----|-----|\n",
    "| **Fill with mean of column** | - Easy to calculate/implement <br> - Retains overall data distribution | - Averages out variation <br> - Affected by outliers (e.g. if one value is much higher/lower than others) |\n",
    "| **Fill with median of column** | - Easy to calculate/implement <br> - Robust to outliers <br> - Preserves center of data  | - Ignores data distribution shape |\n",
    "| **Fill with mode of column** | - Easy to calculate/implement <br> - More useful for categorical-like data | - May not make sense for continuous/numerical data  |\n",
    "| **Fill with 0 (or another constant)** | - Simple to implement <br> - Useful in certain contexts like counts  | - Introduces bias (e.g. if 0 was a value that meant something) <br> - Skews data (e.g. if many missing values, replacing all with 0 makes it look like that's the most common value)  |\n",
    "| **Forward/Backward fill (use previous/future values to fill future/previous values)**  | - Maintains temporal continuity (for time series) | - Assumes data is continuous, which may not be valid |\n",
    "| **Use a calculation from other columns** | - Takes existing information and reinterprets it | - Can result in unlikely outputs if calculations are not continuous | \n",
    "| **Interpolate  (e.g. like dragging a cell in Excel/Google Sheets)** | - Captures trends <br> - Suitable for ordered data | - Can introduce errors <br> - May assume linearity (data continues in a straight line) |\n",
    "| **Drop missing values** | - Ensures complete data (only use samples with all information) <br> - Useful for small datasets | - Can result in data loss (e.g. if many missing values are scattered across columns, data size can be dramatically reduced) <br> - Reduces dataset size  |\n",
    "\n",
    "Which method you choose will be dataset and problem dependant and will likely require several phases of experimentation to see what works and what doesn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we'll fill our missing numeric values with the median value of the target column.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also add a binary column (0 or 1) with rows reflecting whether or not a value was missing.\n",
    "\n",

    "And while we preprocessed it to make sure there were no missing values and the samples were all numeric, we never split the data into separate training and validation splits.\n",

I'd highly recommend spending an hour or so reading through this documentation, even if it doesn't make a lot of sense to begin with.

    "1. Instantiate an encoder, for example, `sklearn.preprocessing.OrdinalEncoder`.\n",
    "2. Use the [`sklearn.preprocessing.OrdinalEncoder.fit`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OrdinalEncoder.html#sklearn.preprocessing.OrdinalEncoder.fit) method on the **training** data (this helps the encoder learn a mapping of categorical to numeric values).\n",
    "3. Use the [`sklearn.preprocessing.OrdinalEncoder.transform`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OrdinalEncoder.html#sklearn.preprocessing.OrdinalEncoder.transform) method on the **training** data to apply the learned mapping from categorical to numeric values.\n",
    "    * **Note:** The [`sklearn.preprocessing.OrdinalEncoder.fit_transform`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OrdinalEncoder.html#sklearn.preprocessing.OrdinalEncoder.fit_transform) method combines steps 1 & 2 into a single method.\n",
    "4. Apply the learned mapping to subsequent datasets such as **validation** and **test** splits using `sklearn.preprocessing.OrdinalEncoder.transform` only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the `fit` and `fit_transform` methods were reserved for the **training dataset only**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because in practice the validation and testing datasets are meant to be unseen, meaning only information from the training dataset should be used to preprocess the validation/test datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instantiate an encoder such as `sklearn.preprocessing.OrdinalEncoder`.\n",
    "2. Fit the encoder to and transform the training dataset categorical variables/features with `sklearn.preprocessing.OrdinalEncoder.fit_transform`.\n",
    "3. Transform categorical variables/features from subsequent datasets such as the validation and test datasets with the learned encoding from step 2 using `sklearn.preprocessing.OridinalEncoder.transform`. \n",
    "    * **Note:** Notice the use of the `transform` method on validation/test datasets rather than `fit_transform`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do it!\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the `OrdinalEncoder` class to fill any missing values with `np.nan` (`NaN`).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also make sure to only use the `OrdinalEncoder` on the categorical features of our DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the `OrdinalEncoder` expects all input variables to be of the same type (e.g. either numeric only or string only) so we'll make sure all the input variables are strings only using [`pandas.DataFrame.astype(str)`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.astype.html)."

So you would expect a model to do better on problems that it has seen before versus problems it hasn't. If you find your model scoring much higher on unseen data versus seen data (e.g. higher scores on the test set compared to the training set), you might want to inspect your data to make sure there isn't any leakage from the validation/test set into the training set."

    "\n",
    "Evaluating a machine learning model is just as important as training one.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so because of this, let's create an evaluation function to make evaluation faster and reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Kaggle for the Bluebook for Bulldozers competition, [the evaluation function](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview/evaluation) they use is root mean squared log error (RMSLE).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{RMSLE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\log(1 + \\hat{y}_i) - \\log(1 + y_i) \\right)^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $ \\hat{y}_i $ is the predicted value,  \n",
    "* $ y_i $ is the actual value,  \n",
    "* $ n $ is the number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrast this with mean absolute error (MAE), another common regression metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{MAE} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left| \\hat{y}_i - y_i \\right| $$\n",
    "\n",
    "With RMSLE, the relative error is more meaningful than the absolute error. You care more about ratios than absolute errors. For example, being off by $100 on a $1000 prediction (10% error) is more significant than being off by $100 on a $10,000 prediction (1% error). RMSLE is sensitive to large percentage errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where as with MAE, is more about exact differences, a $100 prediction error is weighted the same regardless of the actual value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of case, a lower value (closer to 0) is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any problem, it's important to define the evaluation metric you're going to try and improve on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, let's create a function that calculates multiple evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Namely, we'll use:\n",
    "\n",
    "* MAE (mean absolute error) via [`sklearn.metrics.mean_absolute_error`](https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.mean_absolute_error.html) - lower is better.\n",

    "* $R^2$ (R-squared or coefficient of determination) via the [`score` method](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html#sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.score) - higher is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "For MAE and RMSLE we'll be comparing the model's predictions to the truth labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can get an array of predicted values from our model using [`model.predict(X=features_to_predict_on)`](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html#sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.predict). "

    "\n",
    "1. Define a dictionary of hyperparameter values for our `RandomForestRegressor` model. We'll keep `max_samples=10000` so our experiments run faster.\n",
    "2. Setup an instance of `RandomizedSearchCV` to explore the parameter values defined in step 1. We can adjust how many sets of hyperparameters our model tries using the `n_iter` parameter as well as how many times our model performs cross-validation using the `cv` parameter. For example, setting `n_iter=20` and `cv=3` means there will be 3 cross-validation folds for each of the 20 different combinations of hyperparameters, a total of 60 (3*20) experiments.\n",
    "3. Fit the instance of `RandomizedSearchCV` to the data. This will automatically go through the defined number of iterations and record the results for each. The best model gets loaded at the end.\n",

This is due to the [precision of computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_(computer_science)) and the way computers store values, where numbers are exact but can be represented up to a certain amount of precision.

It's likely that samples you collect from the wild may not be as well formatted as samples in a pre-existing dataset.

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "We've covered a lot of ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there are some main takeaways to go over.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Every machine learning problem is different** - Since machine learning is such a widespread technology, it can be used for a multitude of different problems. In saying this, there will often be many different ways to approach a problem. In this example, we've focused on predicting a number, which is a regression problem. And since our data had a time component, it could also be considered a time series problem.\n",
    "* **The machine learner's motto: Experiment, experiment, experiment!** - Since there are many different ways to approach machine learning problems, one of the best habits you can develop is an experimental mindset. That means not being afraid to try new things over and over. Because the more things you try, the quicker you can figure what doesn't work and the quicker you can start to move towards what does.\n",
    "* **Always keep the test set separate** - If you can't evaluate your model on unseen data, how would you know how it will perform in the real world on future unseen data? Of course, using a test set isn't a perfect replica of the real world but if it's done right, it can give you a good idea. Because evaluating a model is just as important as training a model.\n",
    "* **If you've trained a model on a data in a certain format, you'll have to make predictions in the same format** - Any preprocessing you do to the training dataset, you'll have to do to the validation, test and custom data. Any computed values should happen on the training set only and then be used to update any subsequent datasets."

    "1. Fill the missing values in the numeric columns with the median using Scikit-Learn and see if that helps our best model's performance (hint: see [`sklearn.impute.SimpleImputer`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.impute.SimpleImputer.html#sklearn.impute.SimpleImputer) for more).\n",
    "2. Try putting multiple steps together (e.g. preprocessing -> modelling) with Scikit-Learn's [`sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html) features. \n",
    "3. Try using another regression model/estimator on our preprocessed dataset and see how it goes. See the [Scikit-Learn machine learning map](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/machine_learning_map.html) for potential model options.\n",
    "4. Try replacing the `sklearn.preprocessing.OrdinalEncoder` we used for the categorical variables with `sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder` (you may even want to do this within a pipeline) with the `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor` model and see how it performs. Which is better for our specific dataset? "

    "The following resources are suggested extra reading and activities to add backing to the materials we've covered in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading documentation and knowing where to find information is one of the best skills you can develop as an engineer.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Read the pandas [IO tools documentation page](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/io.html#) for an idea of all the possible ways to get data in and out of pandas.\n",
    "* See all of the [available datatypes in the pandas user guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/basics.html#dtypes) (knowing what type your data is in can help prevent a lot of future errors).\n",
    "* Read the Scikit-Learn [dataset transformations](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/data_transforms.html) and [data preprocessing guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html) for an overview of all the different ways you can preprocess and transform data. \n",
    "* For more on saving and loading model objects with Scikit-Learn, see the documentation on [model persistence](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/model_persistence.html).\n",
    "* For more on the importance of creating good validation and test sets, I'd recommend reading [How (and why) to create a good validation set](https://www.fast.ai/2017/11/13/validation-sets/) by Rachel Thomas as well as [The importance of a test set](https://www.learnml.io/posts/the-importance-of-a-test-set/) by Daniel Bourke.\n",
    "* We've covered a handful of models in the Scikit-Learn library, however, there are some other ML models which are worth exploring such as [CatBoost](https://catboost.ai/) and [XGBoost](https://xgboost.ai/). Both of these models can handle missing values and are often touted as some of the most performant ML models on the market. A good extension would be to try get one of them working on our bulldozer data.\n",
    "    * Bonus: You can also see a [list of models in Scikit-Learn which can handle missing/NaN values](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/impute.html#estimators-that-handle-nan-values).   "

For example, on my MacBook Pro M1 Pro it took ~10 minutes with `n_estimators=10` (9x lower than what we used for our `best_model`). This is because using `sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder` adds many more features to our dataset (each feature gets turned into an array of 0's and 1's for each unique value). And the more features, the longer it takes to compute and find patterns between them."
